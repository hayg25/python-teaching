Writing a function means there is <span class=\"girk\">one place to fix mistakes</span>, and when those bugs are fixed, we can be confident that this function will continue to work correctly.\n",
    "- <span class=\"girk\">We can modify our function's behavior, and that change takes effect every time the function is called</span>. This is much better than deciding we need some new behavior, and then having to change code in many different places in our program."
